# Our Tweet class now inherits from ActiveRecord::Base. ActiveRecord now gives us access to tons of methods, including username and status methods for instances of Tweets, and an  'all' method for the class of Tweet. 
# Because we're inheriting all of this from ActiveRecord, we can comment out all of the code that we wrote on days 1 and 2.
class Tweet
  attr_reader :username, :status
  
  ALL = []

  def initialize(username, status)
    @username = username
    @status = status
    ALL << self
  end

  def username
    @username
  end

  def status
    @status
